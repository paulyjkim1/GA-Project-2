# RecipeBook

## Description
Ordering takeout or eating at a restaurant is becoming increasingly more expensive. In Seattle, Washington, I rarely find myself spending less than $15-20 on a meal, not including the gas and time it takes to get to the restaurant. Grocery shopping could potentially cut the cost per meal by over $10 while at the same time giving me a better understanding of what I'm putting in my body. But for someone like me with very little cooking experience, I'm always hesitant to get started. This application will hopefully give me inspiration to find the joy and value in cooking!

RecipeBook will be a social hub to find your next meal! This application allows users to post their recipes as well as browse through other users' recipes. RecipeBook also includes an ingredient tracker which will give nutrition data on a searched ingredient.
